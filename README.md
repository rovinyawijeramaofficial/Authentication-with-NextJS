# Authentication with NextJS
 To implement authentication in Next.js, familiarize yourself with three foundational concepts:  Authentication verifies if the user is who they say they are. It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password. Session Management tracks the user's state (e.g. logged in) across multiple requests. Authorization decides what parts of the application the user is allowed to access. This page demonstrates how to use Next.js features to implement common authentication, authorization, and session management patterns so you can choose the best solutions based on your application's needs.
